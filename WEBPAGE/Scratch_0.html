<h2 style="color:White">As I Lay Dying, an American metalcore band from San Diego, California, was founded in 2000 by vocalist Tim Lambesis. The band has released six albums, one split album, and two compilation albums. The band has kept a similar sound throughout the years and shows no signs of changing that soon with the release of their new banger of a single, My Own Grave. </h2>
