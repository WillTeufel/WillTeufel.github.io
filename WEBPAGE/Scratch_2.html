<h1 style="color:White"><b><u>ASKING ALEXANDRIA</b></h1>
<h2 style="color:White"> Asking Alexandria, an English rock band, was established in 2006 in North Yorkshire. Created by vocalist Danny Worsnop, and guitarist Ben Bruce, The band has released five albums, and an EP album. Asking Alexandria has changed their sound greatly over time, but originally had a very evil style to them. This caused venue owners to ban them from playing many different songs off their first two albums. Their song "Morte et Dabo" brought tons of controversy, containing the lyrics "Bitch, i'll fucking find you, i'll tear the eyes out of your self-righteous face". This controversy only made the band more popular and they have now evolved a more pop punk sound. </h2>
